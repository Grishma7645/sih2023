Rawal's exit led to a lawsuit filed by Akshay's production house, citing breach of contract and financial losses incurred.The entire industry went into a state of shock as Paresh Rawal announced his sudden exit from 'Hera Pheri 3' just when finally, everything was on track. The film has not seen the light of the day since so many years and when finally now, Akshay Kumar bought the rights from producer Feroz Nadiadwala and Priyadarshan on board to direct it, Paresh Rawal backed out. Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowJust as the actor announced his exit from the film, it was reported that Akshay's production house filed a lawsuit against the actor.The legal team of his production house told Times Of India, ""Mr Rawal had publicly acknowledged his participation in the film on 30th January 2025 via a post on his official X.com (formerly Twitter) handle. He further formalised his commitment by executing a Term Sheet dated 27th March 2025, pursuant to which he accepted a part payment of Rs 11,00,000/- towards his remuneration. Acting in complete reliance on his public endorsement and contractual commitment, Cape of Good Films incurred substantial production and promotional expenditures, including those for the teaser and initial film shoot, in which Mr Rawal actively participated.""This of course leads to a larger perspective and conversation about the future prospects of the film considering the fact that fans cannot think of anyone else except for Rawal to play Baburao! As fans hope that Rawal joins the film again, here's what industry insiders have to say. Deja Vu momentIn 2012, Deepika Padukonehad walked out of 'Race 2' which was produced by Ramesh Taurani after the shoot had begun. The actress had walked out of the project after shooting for 5-6 days and it came as a huge shock to everyone. Taurani had said that time in 2012, that Deepika's behaviour was 'unethical, unprofessional and unacceptable' He had also filed a lawsuit against the star as she left his film after signing the contract and after the shoot began.Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowHe had also stated that this is also unfair to the other actors in the film. He had said that time, ""On that day, people kept calling me asking whether Deepika was out of Race 2. I was clueless. I called her and asked her. She simply said that she would come to my office by 5 pm with her new manager to work out everything. At around 3 pm, she called to say that she wouldnât be able to keep the appointment. However, her manager would be present on her behalf. Finally, when the manager arrived, he simply told me that Deepika wouldnât be able to do our film. And thatâs because she is doing a major Hollywood project. Now imagine!""However, now, with the fresh 'Hera Pheri 3' issue as Paresh Rawal backed out of the project, as ETimes contact Ramesh Taurani, he refused to talk about what had happened in the past with Deepika. Infact, the producer said that there is no point of talking about what happened in the past as eventually the film got made, Deepika resumed 'Race 2' and all is now well between the actor and producer. The producer only commented, ""All I want to say is that, mainly when the artist signs the agreement, takes the signing amount and commits his dates and everything, I think he shouldn't go back off, that's not correct.That is not ethical. Whatever the reason may be, but it shouldn't be done.""Trade perspective A situation like this which has gotten serious now, may really affect 'Hera Pheri 3' and the future of it. However, one hopes that all goes well and in that case, a controversy like this only is a testament to people's anticipation towards the film. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh opines that this issue could just have been sorted internally.He says, ""I wish Akshay and Paresh would have sat across the table and sorted it out. This entire thing of sending a notice to Paresh Rawal is something which doesn't really sound nice. They have been friends and they have been colleagues for almost three decades now, and I think it's not right to actually take it to a legal level. I feel that way. But anyway, I hope good sense prevails and they sit across the table and sort it out.Film trade expert Girish Wankhede adds, ""I believe that the ongoing controversy surrounding 'Hera Pheri 3' will not adversely affect its prospects. In fact, it has garnered additional media attention, which can be beneficial. However, the conflict involving Akshay Kumar, the producer, and Paresh Rawal casts a shadow over the film industry as a whole. The chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal is exceptional, and Paresh Rawal is one of the few actors who has consistently collaborated with director Priyadarshan.Given that Priyadarshan has directed numerous successful films featuring Paresh Rawal, any deterioration in this relationship could reflect poorly on the industry, suggesting a lack of loyalty among friends.""He added, ""While the business side of things looks promisingâafter all, 'Hera Pheri' is a highly successful franchise that has the potential to grow even larger in terms of scale and brand recognitionâthe underlying issues are concerning. This situation serves as a reminder of the complexities within the film industry, where personal disputes can overshadow professional relationships.Netizens react: 'No Hera Pheri without Babu bhaiya' Paresh Rawal took to X and clarified, ""I wish to put it on record that my decision to step away from Hera Pheri 3 was not due to creative differences. I REITERATE THAT THERE ARE NO CREATIVE DISAGREEMENT WITH THE FILM MAKER . I hold immense love, respect, and faith in Mr. Priyadarshan the film director."" Here's how netizens had reacted to his exit.A user said, ""Sir main nas kaat lunga, take your decision back. Paise jyada chahiye toh hum Hera pheri fan club crowdsource kar denge.""Another one said, ""Hera Pheri without Baburao is hard to imagine.You made the role unforgettable with your perfect timing and expressions.No matter what, fans will always think of you first when they think of Hera Pheri. Still hoping that itâs just a marketing campaign to get some hype and thereâs a surprise and you return â because no one can take Baburaoâs place!""Clearly, people unanimously believe there can't be 'Hera Pheri 3' without Paresh Rawal and hope the actor is back on board! Meanwhile, director Priyadarshan recently said in an interview with Mid-day, All our contracts were signed. Ten days ago, Suniel, Akshay, and Paresh shot a scene and the IPL teaser. It was only after we unanimously agreed to do Hera Pheri 3 that Akshay bought the rights (of Hera Pheri 3). Akshay had tears in his eyes when he asked me, âPriyan, why is Paresh doing this to us?â Akshay shouldnât suffer financial losses because Paresh walked out on a whim.""Check out our list of the latest Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada movies.

Her appearance is considered a highlight of Cannes 2025. She continues to be a Bollywood legend and style icon.Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, a stalwart of the Cannes Film Festival since her debut in 2002, graced the red carpet for the 22nd time in 2025. Arriving with her daughter, Aaradhya, she continued her tradition of sharing this global platform with her family.Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowThis year, Aishwarya turned heads in a stunning ivory and gold traditional outfit paired with statement jewelry that exuded royal elegance. What truly captured attention was the deep red sindoor in her hair partingâan iconic symbol of Indian traditionâproudly worn like a crown. Her rich maroon lipstick, intricately layered necklaces, and flowing hair completed the look, blending grace with grandeur.The outfit, adorned with elaborate embroidery and paired with a cape-style dupatta, paid homage to her Indian roots while asserting her place as a global fashion icon. Aishwarya once again proved that she doesn't follow trendsâshe sets them.Her appearance is already being hailed as one of the most memorable of Cannes 2025, reinforcing her legacy not just as a Bollywood legend, but as a timeless style queen on the international stage.Her sindoor sparked attention not just as a style statement, but against the backdrop of ongoing rumours about her marriage to Abhishek Bachchan. Throughout 2024, speculation of a possible split gained momentum, driven by their irregular public appearances and noticeable absences from each otherâs social media and key events. Despite the buzz, the couple has continued to refute the rumours by making joint appearances at several events this year.Recently, a video of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan dancing at a wedding in Mumbai sparked speculation that she might skip the Cannes Film Festival this year. However, her arrival in Nice has put all those rumours to rest. The 78th Cannes Film Festival is set to feature a strong Indian presence. Acclaimed writer-director Payal Kapadia joins the prestigious main competition jury this year. Bollywood legends Sharmila Tagore and Simi Garewal graced the festival for the world premiere of the newly restored version of Satyajit Rayâs 1970 classic Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest). Filmmakers Karan Johar and Neeraj Ghaywan are also in attendance to present their film Homebound, with Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter set to walk the red carpet for the screening.See more: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan shuts down divorce rumours with sindoor and saree power at CannesCheck out our list of the latest Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada movies.

Mira has now shed light on how these values influence not just her personal life, but also her business decisions.Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowMira about her vegetarian lifestyleIn a recent conversation with Forbes India, Mira recounted how she once declined a proposal to invest in a restaurant venture, as it conflicted with her dietary ethics and principles. Despite being involved in the business world through her own line of beauty products, she made it clear that she draws a firm line when it comes to ventures that do not align with her beliefs.Shahid Kapoor clicked with family at airport; his son Zain grabs everyoneâs attentionâI am a vegetarian, and I am very particular about what I eat. I donât eat eggs or things like that. Once, someone approached me with a restaurant business proposal, and I said, âWell, I am a vegetarian and I donât drink alcohol, so I am not going to be involved in a business that does that. I wish you all the very best, but it doesnât align with my principles,ââ Mira shared.Gurmeet & Debina's Sweet Day at Candy CityTake on public scrutinyShe went on to highlight the significance of remaining grounded and staying true to oneâs identity, particularly when constantly exposed to public scrutiny. Mira pointed out that being in the spotlight often invites a range of opinions from others, but it is crucial to ensure that oneâs own inner voice remains the strongest. She stressed the importance of consistently reminding oneself of their core values and beliefs, without allowing external noise to influence or overshadow them. Mira noted that while others are entitled to their views, it is vital to recognise one's own mistakes, understand personal non-negotiables, and remain true to one's integrity. According to her, the inner voice shaped by oneâs values should always be strong and clear, offering reassurance even when faced with criticism or disapproval.Celebrities such as Shilpa Shetty, Virat Kohli, Gauri Khan, Malaika Arora, Asha Bhosle, and Bobby Deol have all successfully launched or co-own restaurant businesses.Check out our list of the latest Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada movies.

He highlighted the no-win situation celebrities often face, citing instances of unintended association with controversial figures and corporate scams. Shetty defended the film industry's intentions, asserting its commitment to India-centric values and responsible conduct amidst growing public scrutiny.Ahead of the release of his upcoming historical drama Kesari Veer, actor Suniel Shetty spoke with ABP, addressing not just the film but a host of topics dominating public discourse. These included the growing boycott culture in the industry, particularly aimed at Aamir Khanâs Sitaare Zameen Par, and the status of Hera Pheri 3 amidst reported tensions with co-star Paresh Rawal.Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowâHumesha Bollywood ke peeche pade rehte hai,â Shetty said, asserting that the film industry is often unfairly singled out. âBollywood doesn't come forward in this. Desh ke bare mein hoga toh politicians baat karenge, desh ke hit mein hoga toh hum definitely support karenge, thatâs why we even make such films.âAddressing the backlash against Aamir Khan, reportedly over his past visit to Turkey, Shetty encouraged people to move forward. âPeople should forget the past. The past history does not represent today's time. Turkeyâs situation then and now are very different,â he said. âWhat we do going forward should be our own decision, rather than judging based on the past.ââDamned if you do, damned if you donâtâSuniel Shetty also spoke about how celebrities often find themselves in a no-win situation: âWhen you go for big social gatherings, you donât always know the people youâre posing for pictures with. In todayâs time, if you donât pose, you're called 'rude', and if you do so unknowingly, you still become a target.âHe shared personal instances where he faced such scenarios. âThis has happened so many times with meâsomeone with a controversial background is standing next to me, and I have no idea. Hum to waise bhi dono taraf se maar hi khaate rehte hain.âSuniel Shetty, Sooraj Pancholi Promote FilmâEven legit companies turn out to be scamsâThe Dhadkan actor recalled an incident where he was invited to a corporate event that later turned out to be connected to a scam. Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowâI once attended an event hosted by a company that looked very promising. Two years later, it turned out to be a scam. It becomes extremely difficult to differentiate and judge people or organizations in such scenarios,â he explained.Despite the growing scrutiny and unpredictable fallout of public interactions, Shetty maintained that the film industry tries to act responsibly. âWe are trying to do our job. Speaking about my industry, I can say there are more India-centric individuals here than anywhere else in the world,â he said, defending the intentions of filmmakers and artists across Bollywood.Check out our list of the latest Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada movies.

He might finally win Coach of the Year. Analysts predict a 9-8 season for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team traded Diontae Johnson. They did not acquire a top quarterback. Tomlin remains optimistic. He believes in his team. Arthur Smith is building an offense around Mason Rudolph. The Steelers defense is younger.Mike Tomlin has been the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2007. During all these years, he never had a losing season, which is very rare in the NFL. Nevertheless, he has never received the NFL Coach of the Year award.Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowNumerous individuals within the football community now think that 2025 may be the year Mike Tomlin will at last receive that recognition. Next season is not shaping up to be an easy one for theSteelers, but that might just benefit Mike Tomlin's argument.Mike Tomlin has toughest test in 2025 but may at last win Coach of the YearThis season, the Pittsburgh Steelers are not regarded as a strong team by most analysts. This past May of 2025, prior to the season beginning, analysts on NFL Network and ESPN were forecasting that the Pittsburgh Steelers could only go 9-8 this season.The team made some puzzling moves during the offseason. They traded wide receiver Diontae Johnson on March 12, 2025, for draft picks in the future. They did not bring in a definitive top quarterback either, though Aaron Rodgers rumors were the talk in early April.In spite of this, Mike Tomlin is unshaken. At a press conference on May 5, 2025, in Pittsburgh, he stated, ""Every season has new challenges. That's part of the job. But I believe in this group.""His optimism has players and fans anxiously observing. If Mike Tomlin is able to get this team into the playoffs, it will be difficult for the league to disregard his work.Offense and defense can stealthily propel Pittsburgh Steelers into playoff conversationThe Pittsburgh Steelers have made some adjustments that may serve them well. Offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has constructed a scheme that plays to the strengths of quarterback Mason Rudolph.Running back Jaylen Warren and rookie Kaleb Johnson are impressive. Tight end Pat Freiermuth and wide receiver D.K. Metcalf will be a major target.The defense is younger now, with new faces on the line and depth at linebacker. There are questions in the secondary, but Mike Tomlin said on May 10 via Steelers.com, âWeâll clean things up in camp.âAlso Read: âS*x offender in the house, great move Giantsâ: Lawrence Taylor delivers a motivational speech to the 2025 New York Giants team | NFL News - Times of IndiaGet IPL 2025 match schedules, squads, points table, and live scores for CSK, MI, RCB, KKR, SRH, LSG, DC, GT, PBKS, and RR.

Selectors are likely to overlook Mohammed Shami and Shreyas Iyer, while considering Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair. The squad will feature a mix of experienced players and fresh faces in pace and spin departments.MUMBAI: The 'coronation Day' Shubman Gill as Indiaâs new Test captain has finally arrived. When the national selectors meet at the BCCI HQ here on Saturday at 1pm to pick the squad for the upcoming five-Test tour of England, Gill is all set to be named as the new captain of India's red-ball team.Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowWhile the 25-year-old Punjab batter will lead the side, either KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant would be his deputy. According to a reliable source, premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah ruled himself out of the captaincy race when he informed the selectors that he would not be interested in the job as he will not be able to play in all the five Tests in England. Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!This will be India's first Test series since the Test retirements of the superstar duo of Rohit Sharma (previous Test captain) and Virat Kohli. The selection meeting is set to be followed by a press conference of chief selector Ajit Agarkar.PollShould the selectors consider veteran players like Cheteshwar Pujara for the Test squad?Yes, experience is vitalNo, it's time for new talentLike they did in the case of the Australian tour in Dec-Jan, the selectors are likely to ignore veteran pacer Mohammed Shami for the gruelling tour as the 34-year-old's ability to bowl long spell is a concern, and there's little chance that he will be able to feature in all the five Tests. With Bumrah already having informed the BCCI that he wouldn't feature in more than three Tests, taking another bowler who can't last the series isn't a great idea. Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil HughesIyer likely to be snubbedAccording to sources, the selectors are likely to ignore Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer from India's Test squad, despite the middle-order batter having done well for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in the 2024-25 season. The 30-year-old scored 480 runs @68.57, with two centuries, in five matches in the Ranji Trophy last year. A big indication that Iyer wasn't there in the selectors' scheme of things was evident when he was ignored from the India A squad shadow tour to England, which precedes the series.Tired of too many ads?go ad free now""Iyer's new stance, bold strokeplay, carefree attitude to batting are all suited to the white-ball game now. The selectors aren't convinced about his red-ball skills,"" a source tracking developments told TOI.Sudharsan, Nair sure picksTwo batters who are definitely in with a contention for a berth in the India squad are Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair. Both have been picked for the India A tour to England-the team will depart on Sunday- though Sudharsan will only join the side from the second match. Primed for a Test comeback after as long as eight years, Nair has been a prolific scorer in domestic circuit - he slammed 863 runs in nine Ranji Trophy matches with four centuries at an average of 53.93 to play a stellar role in Vidarbha's third Ranji Trophy triumph.Even in the 2023-24 Ranji season, Nair had stroked 690 runs in 10 matches@40.58, with two centuries and three fifties, to help Vidarbha finish as finalists. The 30-year-old's high point in domestic cricket, though, came in the Vijay Hazare Trophy last season, when he smashed 779 runs in nine matches (eight innings) at an incredible average of 389.50, with five centuries. ""If the selectors don't pick someone who has shown such consistency in domestic cricket, then what's the point of playing domestic cricket. He's a certainty,"" a source tracking developments told TOI.Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI futureThe 23-year-old Sai has been on fire while playing for the Gujarat Titans in IPL-2025, and is currently the leading run-scorer in the League with 638 runs in 13 matches @53.16, fifth five fifties and a hundred under his belt. The left-handed from Tamil Nadu has been rated highly, and it would help that his opening partner and captain Gill will now be the new captain of the Test side. The only glitch is that Sudharsan's first-class ecord isnât great-he has scored 1957 runs in 29 matches@39.93, with seven hundred and five fifties.However, his technique, temperament, consistency and strokeplay all make Sudharsan an attractive package.Highly impressed with Sudarshan, his batting colleague at Gujarat Titans, former England white-ball captain Jos Buttler had told the official broadcaster, âI've said it a few times, day one watching him in the nets, I was blown away by how good he is. More importantly, (he's got) great head on his shoulders. The effort he puts in, the work, the understanding of his game, the humility to keep coming everyday and keep working.He's shown fantastic consistency and getting the rewards he deserves.âWhile he has formed a successful opening partnership with Gill in the ongoing IPL, Sudharshan is unlikely to open in England. The Indian team management is likely to continue with the opening combination of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul. With Gill likely to slip down to No 4 to fill in the big shoes of Kohli at that slot, the No. 3 slot could be a toss-up between Sudharsan and Nair.Shane Watson on Phil Hughes: âIt Took the Innocence of the Game AwayMumbai's middle-order batter Sarfaraz Khan too could find a place in the squad. Though he couldn't get a game in the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia which India lost 3-1, Sarfaraz has been picked for the India A side to tour England. It would help Sarfaraz's case that both Devdutt Padikkal, who was preferred ahead of him in the first BGT Test in Nov last year at the No 3 slot, and Rajat Patidar are nursing injuries. Named as the India captain for the nth time, Abhimanyu Easwaran is likely to be retained in the side as the third opener.Sources revealed that there is a though that the vastly-experienced Cheteshwar Pujara (37) could take up a 'VRS' offer if picked and retire at the end of the series, especially absence of seniors like Rohit and Kohli, but it's unlikely that the selectors and team management will go back in time as the series marks the start of the new World Test Championship cycle.Shami is expected to be ruled out but the final verdict will be taken basis the report from NCA. That leaves room for Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep and Harshit Rana as pacers. Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar will be the spinning allrounders, while Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has been asked to bowl more recently by the selectors, and Shardul Thakur will be the seam bowling all-rounders.The lone specialist spinner will be Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav. The two wicketkeepers will be the out-of-form Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel.The likely squad: Shubman Gill (captain), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Sai Sudharsan, Sarfaraz Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Rishabh Pant, Druv Jurel, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Shardul Thakur and Kuldeep Yadav.India are set to depart for England on June 6, with the first Test of the series scheduled to begin on June 20 at Headingley in Leeds.Get IPL 2025 match schedules, squads, points table, and live scores for CSK, MI, RCB, KKR, SRH, LSG, DC, GT, PBKS, and RR.

The sale ends a troubled period marked by multiple relegations and fan unrest.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementReal Valladolid fans protest with a banner directed at owner Ronaldo inside the stadium (Reuters Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 23, 2025 23:06 ISTIn ShortRonaldo owned 51% of Valladolid since 2018Club relegated three times during his tenureFans protested Ronaldo's absence at matchesBrazilian football legend Ronaldo Nazrio has ended his controversial tenure as majority owner of Real Valladolid, selling his controlling stake to a North American investment group, the club confirmed on Friday. The sale marks the conclusion of a six-year spell marked by moments of hope, recurring setbacks, and mounting frustration from fans and local officials.The announcement comes just a day before Valladolid's final match of a dismal season, where they will face Legans sitting bottom of the table with only 16 points. Their relegation from LaLiga was sealed in April, capping off one of the worst campaigns in the club's recent history, with 29 defeats and two managerial sackings.advertisementRonaldo, 48, acquired a 51% stake in Valladolid in 2018 for around 30 million, bringing with him the global stature of a two-time World Cup winner and one of the game's most iconic strikers. His arrival sparked excitement and optimism in the Castilian city, with hopes that his experience and connections could elevate the modest club into a sustainable LaLiga presence. Instead, his tenure has seen Valladolid relegated three times - in the 2020-21, 2022-23, and now 2024-25 seasons. While the club bounced back quickly after the first two drops, this latest relegation seems to have broken what was left of the bond between Ronaldo and the fanbase.This season in particular has seen the relationship between Ronaldo and the club deteriorate beyond repair. The former striker was largely absent from matches, reportedly attending only three Valladolid games all season while being seen more frequently at Real Madrid fixtures and even tennis tournaments. One protest by fans involved throwing tennis balls onto the pitch in outrage after Ronaldo was spotted at a professional tennis event instead of supporting his team.advertisementThe situation prompted frequent calls from fans and public officials alike for his departure, making the eventual sale widely welcomed in Valladolid. The club revealed that Ronaldo had reached an agreement with a yet-unnamed North American investment group to sell his majority share, pending approval from the club's Advisory Board. Further details on the financial terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed, although it's believed Ronaldo was initially seeking 40 million for his stake.This isn't Ronaldo's first exit from club ownership. In 2023, he sold his majority stake in Cruzeiro, the Brazilian club where he began his professional career, after a similarly contentious period.While the full impact of his departure remains to be seen, many in Valladolid will view it as a chance for a fresh start. The new ownership group, though still under wraps, will be tasked with restoring trust, stability, and ultimately, LaLiga status to a club that has endured years of yo-yo fortunes under one of football's most storied names.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: May 23, 2025 Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchPakistan should be isolated, condemned for sponsoring terrorism: Anand Sharma

The case, filed on the directions of the Ministry of Home Affairs, pertains to a broader conspiracy involving organised criminal syndicates engaged in fund-raising and recruitment for unlawful activities.advertisement According to the NIA, Sarkar arranged forged travel documents to help gang members flee the country after committing crimes.

Following this, the court cracked the whip on the officer who delayed the execution of its orders, stating that once an order is passed, compliance is not optional. The court also noted with concern that such conduct by public authorities is not an isolated incident. It further observed that even after judicial intervention, the concerned authorities, for reasons best known to them, either delay or altogether ignore compliance.The contempt plea was filed by two siblings regarding a case where 17 cents of their land adjacent to Nesapakkam Road in Chennai was acquired in 1983 for constructing Tamil Nadu Housing Board tenements. When the land was not utilised for many years, the petitioners initiated a legal battle seeking reconveyance of the land in 2003.advertisementAround 10.5 cents of the land was returned to them, but the remaining 6.5 cents was retained for the purpose of widening the Nesapakkam Road. Again, the sibling petitioners approached the High Court seeking a deed of reconveyance.In 2023, the HC directed the CMDA Member Secretary to consider the couple’s plea and pass appropriate orders within 2 months. Since the order was not complied with, the petitioners filed a contempt case in 2024 against the IAS officer.Under simple imprisonment, a person convicted of an offence is to be kept in prison without any hard labour. Such a convicted person is only required to do light duties.Published By: Avijit DasPublished On: May 23, 2025 IN THIS STORY#Chennai#Tamil NaduWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchPakistan should be isolated, condemned for sponsoring terrorism: Anand Sharma So Sorry: Operation 'Welcome'Gang rape accused given hero's welcome in Karnataka after bailHunt for terrorists continues in J&K's Kishtwar after fierce gunfightPakistan army official threatens India over Indus water treaty suspensionAdvertisementRead ThisNot optional: Madras High Court jails IAS officer for a month in contempt caseBrazilian Ronaldo sells majority stake in Real Valladolid after six-year spellKarnataka gang rape accused who got heroes' welcome after bail arrested again23 active Covid-19 cases in Delhi, no need to panic: Delhi Health MinisterKey aide of Lawrence Bishnoi arrested for aiding fugitives with fake passportsAdvertisement",,[],www.indiatoday.in,2025-05-24T05:54:46.794,566,['official'],sign inedition ininushome tvlive tvprimetimemagazinelatest editioninsightbest collegeslifestyleindiasouthglobalall world newsus newscanada newsuk newschina newsindians abroadbusinessall sportsipl 2025cricketfootballsports todaytennistechnologyshowbuzzentertainmentbollywoodhollywoodtelevisionottlatest reviewsnewspresso specialspodcastsfirst thing fastsunday specialhistory itnewsmodiuinteractivesopiniongamesvideosshort videosfact check newseducationits viralsciencehealthautolaw todayenvironmentcitiesweatherweb storieshoroscopesdownload appfollow u newslawnot optional madras high court jail ia officer month contempt casenot optional madras high court jail ia officer month contempt caseanshul mishra former member secretary chennai metropolitan development authority cmda sentenced one month simple imprisonment contempt case listen storylive tvshareadvertisementthe senior ia officer also ordered pay compensation r 25000anaghachennaiupdated may 23 2025 2312 istedited avijit dasin shortanshul mishra ordered pay r 25000 compensation two elderly petitionersthe 2023 court order ignored two year prompting contempt actioncase involves land reconveyance dispute related chennai housing projectthe madras high court friday sentenced senior indian administrative service ia officer one month simple imprisonment contempt case wilfully wantonly disobeying order passed court 2023anshul mishra former member secretary chennai metropolitan development authority cmda also directed court pay compensation r 25000 salary two aged petitioner r lalithambai k vishwanathanadvertisementthe 2023 order complied even two year following court cracked whip officer delayed execution order stating order passed compliance optional court also noted concern conduct public authority isolated incident observed even judicial intervention concerned authority reason best known either delay altogether ignore compliancethe contempt plea filed two sibling regarding case 17 cent land adjacent nesapakkam road chennai acquired 1983 constructing tamil nadu housing board tenement land utilised many year petitioner initiated legal battle seeking reconveyance land 2003advertisementaround 105 cent land returned remaining 65 cent retained purpose widening nesapakkam road sibling petitioner approached high court seeking deed reconveyancein 2023 hc directed cmda member secretary consider couple ’ plea pas appropriate order within 2 month since order complied petitioner filed contempt case 2024 ia officerunder simple imprisonment person convicted offence kept prison without hard labour convicted person required light dutiespublished avijit daspublished may 23 2025 storychennaitamil naduwatch live tv advertisementalso watchpakistan isolated condemned sponsoring terrorism anand sharma sorry operation welcomegang rape accused given hero welcome karnataka bailhunt terrorist continues jks kishtwar fierce gunfightpakistan army official threatens india indus water treaty suspensionadvertisementread thisnot optional madras high court jail ia officer month contempt casebrazilian ronaldo sell majority stake real valladolid sixyear spellkarnataka gang rape accused got hero welcome bail arrested again23 active covid19 case delhi need panic delhi health ministerkey aide lawrence bishnoi arrested aiding fugitive fake passportsadvertisement,positive,0.117045454545455

First, India has experienced decades of Pakistani-sponsored terrorist attacks across our borders,"" Ambassador Puri said. ""For such a nation to even participate in a discussion on the protection of civilians is an affront to the international community. A nation that makes no distinction between terrorists and civilians has no credentials to speak about protecting civilians,"" he added.Referring to a recent incident, Puri alleged that the Pakistani army had deliberately targeted Indian border villages earlier this month.""More than 20 civilians were killed and over 80 injured. There was intentional targeting of places of worship — including gurdwaras, temples, and convents — as well as medical facilities. To preach at this body after such behaviour is grossly hypocritical,"" he said.advertisementIn a strong response, Harish said India has experienced decades of ""Pakistani-sponsored terrorist attacks across our borders"".“This has ranged from the horrific 26/11 attack on the city of Mumbai to the barbaric mass murder of innocent tourists in Pahalgam in April 2025. The victims of Pakistani terrorism have been predominantly civilians, since its objective has been to attack our prosperity, progress and morale. For such a nation to even participate in a discussion on the protection of civilians is an affront to the international community,” Harish said.He added that Pakistan has repeatedly used civilian cover to advance the cause of terrorism.""We just recently saw senior government, police and military officials pay respects at the funeral of noted terrorists targeted by Operation Sindoor.

Neither the menu nor the bill suggests that gravy was included with, or promised alongside, the ordered dishes.”advertisement The complainant, a freelance journalist, visited the restaurant in Kolenchery last year with a friend. They ordered beef fry and porotta and requested gravy to accompany the meal.The waiter informed them that the restaurant did not provide gravy, a policy confirmed by the manager.Following this, the journalist filed a complaint seeking compensation of Rs 1,00,000 for mental agony, Rs 10,000 towards legal costs, and a recommendation for legal action against the restaurant under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.However, the Commission ruled that the complaint was not maintainable under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.It stated that the restaurant’s internal policy regarding accompaniments cannot be considered a deficiency in service without any legal or contractual obligation.The complainant had argued that the restaurant’s policy amounted to a restrictive trade practice, designed to compel customers to buy an additional curry to get basic gravy, thus exploiting consumers.advertisementThe Commission did not find merit in this claim.Published By: Akshat

Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementIndia are in search for a new Test captain after Rohit Sharma's retirement. Courtesy: PTIIndia Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 23, 2025 19:49 ISTIn ShortJasprit Bumrah's fitness concerns cloud his captaincy prospectsShubman Gill is the frontrunner to succeed Rohit SharmaExperts favour Jasprit Bumrah with Gill or Pant as deputiesAfter Rohit Sharma's retirement from Test cricket and Virat Kohli's departure from the format, India need a new Test captain. Among the frontrunners are Shubman Gill and Jasprit Bumrah-two players with contrasting styles and leadership credentials. But rising through the chatter is a third name that refuses to be ignored: Rishabh Pant.The national selection committee, led by Ajit Agarkar, is set to meet at the BCCI headquarters on Saturday to finalise India's Test squad for the upcoming tour of England-a five-match series beginning June 20 at Headingley, which also marks the start of the new World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.advertisementBumrah, for his part, has shown he can lead with both skill and composure, earning the respect of teammates through performance and presence. He first captained India in the rescheduled fifth Test against England in 2022 and later in the opening and final matches of the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, his leadership ambitions are shadowed by his physical limitations. Persistent stress-related issues in his lower back-culminating in surgery two years ago-have forced him to manage his workload carefully. Most recently, he was ruled out on just the second day of the Sydney Test earlier this year and subsequently missed the Champions Trophy. Though he made his return to the IPL, medical advice strongly cautions against featuring in every match of a demanding Test series like the one upcoming in England.In contrast, Gill's trajectory has been steadily upward. At just 25, he has already been entrusted with vice-captaincy in both white-ball formats and has shown promise as a leader in the IPL with Gujarat Titans. While he lacks leadership experience in Tests or ODIs, his stint as captain during the 2024 Zimbabwe T20 tour offered a glimpse of his potential. In 32 Tests so far, Gill has scored 1,893 runs-including five centuries-while showcasing flexibility across the top order.advertisementSelectors are reportedly seeking a captain who can lead with continuity and vision throughout the WTC cycle, positioning Gill as the frontrunner to succeed Rohit Sharma.Yet, the leadership debate wouldn't be complete without mention of Rishabh Pant. Despite missing significant time due to injury, Pant remains one of India's most dependable Test performers overseas. He averages over 42 in Tests, with centuries in Australia, England, and South Africa, and an additional seven scores in the 90s. His fearless approach and big-match temperament make him an appealing, if untested, leadership option.KL Rahul, once floated as a short-term solution, appears to be out of contention as selectors shift focus to long-term leadership stability.As the countdown to the England series begins, IndiaToday.in explores expert opinions and weighs the credentials of the top contenders to succeed Rohit Sharma as the next Test captain of India.Sunil Gavaskar (Former India captain)""Who better to know what is the workload for himself than himself? If you appoint somebody else, they would always want an extra over from Bumrah. If he is your No. 1 bowler, he will himself know that 'yes, this is the time I must take a break'. To me, it has to be Jasprit Bumrah only. I know all these kind of speculation going around his workload and all that. Give it to him so that he knows how many overs to bowl, when to take him off, when to sort of rest. That would be the best thing,"" Gavaskar said.advertisement""He (Bumrah) may not have to miss a Test match. If you give it him, he might know when to stop before his body starts to crumble. For me, give it to him. After the first Test, there is an eight-day gap. There's enough time to recover. Then, there are two back-to-back Test matches. That's fine. There's then another gap. If you give him the captaincy, he will be the best person to know when to bowl,"" he added.Ravi Shastri (Former India coach)""See for me, Jasprit would have been the obvious choice after Australia,"" Shastri said. ""But I don't want Jasprit to be made captain and then you lose him as a bowler."" ""I think he (Bumrah) has to take his body one game at a time. He's coming back now after a serious injury,"" Shastri noted.""He'll have played IPL cricket, which is four-over cricket. Now will come the test of bowling 10 overs, 15 overs. And the last thing you want is some pressure on his mind being captain as well.""advertisement""You groom somebody and I would say Shubman's looked very good. Give him the opportunity. He's 25, 26 years of age, even give him time,"" Shastri said. ""There's Rishabh as well. I think these two are the obvious ones I'm looking at because of their age and they have a decade ahead of them. So, let them learn.""Sanjay Bangar (Former India batting coach)""You would be mistaken if you were thinking really long term. Gill's quite young. He's got loads of cricket ahead of him, and he would also have attained that self-belief in his ability by doing well overseas. So that is a challenge for him to be doing that on a consistent basis. So he's your long-term prospect, no doubt. But whether you want to elevate him immediately, I don't really think that there is a reason to do that because you have a KL Rahul. He has captained India in the past when Virat gave up captaincy in South Africa. I think he captained one of the best matches, and he's a guaranteed starter at the top of the order. So that is the reason I believe that, yes, you can think long term after the next WTC cycle. By that time, I think Shubman Gill would have established his credentials in a much more solid way, and he would have plenty of experience behind him,"" he explained.advertisementRavi Ashwin (Former India spinner)""First of all, everyone is saying that Gill is the captain. Everyone is going in that direction. But there is a loud option in Jasprit Bumrah, and why do we forget about Ravindra Jadeja,"" Ashwin said. ""If you are willing to go for a new person as captain, I would say why not make him [Gill] an understudy of an experienced guy for two years before handing him the job on a full-time basis.""""Look at Pat Cummins, he also had a back stress fracture, but he is now captaining Australia in Tests and ODIs,"" Ashwin said. ""Like that, Bumrah is our national treasure and he should be in the discussion. ""He should be asked, will you be able to play five Tests? Can you be a full-time captain? I know he had a stress fracture but I am sure he will think about it. I think the hat with his name should be number one in that ring.""advertisementIshant Sharma (Veteran India pacer)""If Bumrah is fit, I would say Bumrah. That's first choice. He is the only one who has so much experience. But if he won't play all the five Tests matches, then obviously Shubman,"" Ishant said.Devang Gandhi (Former National Selector)""For captaincy, it would be unfair if you don't consider Bumrah for leadership. As far as Bumrah deputy goes, this is the time to show faith in Rishabh Pant as he has the best Test average in the current set-up. I would carry six specialist pacers in UK knowing that I have enough back-up for a five-match series,"" Gandhi said.MSK Prasad (Former chairman of selectors)""My captain would be Jasprit Bumrah as he has already proven himself as a leader. As far as my vice-captain is concerned, I would like Shubman Gill to gain some experience as Bumrah's deputy. In case you have a problem with Bumrah's fitness then my choice is KL Rahul,"" Prasad said in an interview.Jatin Paranjpe (Former National Selector)""There is no one more ideal than Jasprit Bumrah to lead the national team in traditional format. My vice-captain would be Rishabh Pant, who has had a good record in SENA countries. ""Pant and KL Rahul are the two batters with two Test hundreds on English soil on their previous tours,"" Paranjpe said.Kris Srikkanth (Former chairman of selectors)""Who's a ready-made captaincy candidate now? Shubman Gill? I don't think he is still a certainty in the XI,"" Srikkanth said. ""You're not handing the captaincy to KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant. Otherwise, you give it to Jasprit Bumrah. ""The other choice is Bumrah. You say, 'Boss, you're the captain'. And whichever Test match he doesn't play, you give KL Rahul the responsibility.""As of now, I think Bumrah should be the captain. If I were the chairman of selectors, I would make Bumrah the captain. And then I'd say, 'Boss, play whichever matches you want to'. I'd then appoint KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant as vice-captain because these are certainties in the XI.Published By: Saurabh KumarPublished On: May 23, 2025 You May Also Like Watch Live TV

(Image for representation)Aneesha MathurNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 23, 2025 23:52 ISTEdited By: Vivek KumarIn ShortSupreme Court cites reproductive rights of women under human rights lawWoman's 3rd child was born after she joined government serviceTamil Nadu government argues maternity benefits limited to two childrenThe Supreme Court on Friday observed that maternity leave is integral to maternity benefits and reproductive rights are now recognised as part of several intersecting domains of international human rights law, setting aside a Madras High Court order which denied the facility to a government teacher who was awaiting the birth of her third child. The high court had cited state policy restricting benefits to two children.advertisementThe bench comprising Justices AS Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan in its verdict noted that there is a need to ""harmonise"" the policy objective of population control and maternity benefits for women employees.""We have delved into the concept of reproductive rights and have held that maternity benefits are a part of reproductive rights and maternity leave is integral to maternity benefits. Therefore, the impugned order has been set aside,"" the bench noted. ""Reproductive rights are now recognised as part of several intersecting domains of international human rights law viz. the right to health, right to privacy, right to equality and non-discrimination and the right to dignity,"" it added.The top court made a distinction between her first two pregnancies and the third one when it came to availing the benefits of the state policy on maternity leaves.WHAT IS THE CASE?advertisementThe order was pronounced in an appeal filed by a Tamil Nadu-based government school teacher, who had two biological children with her first husband, born in 2007 and 2011. She then entered government service in 2012, as a school teacher.The couple parted ways after a divorce in 2017, and the woman got married again in 2019. In 2021, she applied for maternity leave of nine months, but was denied.The authorities noted that the maternity leave benefit was available only for ""up to two living children"". This being her third pregnancy, with two children living with her first husband, would make her ineligible.The teacher moved the high court challenging the denial of maternity leave. While a single-judge bench accepted her argument and granted maternity leave, the Tamil Nadu government filed a counter-appeal. A Division bench of the high court then set aside the single-judge order. The division bench also held that the grant of maternity leave was not a fundamental right.The petitioner approached the Supreme Court against this order.TAMIL NADU GOVERNMENT'S STANDThe Tamil Nadu government in its submissions noted that the rules relating to maternity benefits bar the grant of maternity benefits beyond the second child.The state government's counsel also argued that any deviation from the established policy would potentially overwhelm the exchequer and impact administrative efficacy. Further, he claimed that this would amount to incentivising the breach of population control norms.SUPREME COURT OBSERVATIONadvertisementThe Supreme Court has held that the appellant teacher shall be granted maternity leave under FR 101(a) of the Tamil Nadu rules. It has also directed the state to release the maternity benefits that apply to be released within two months.""In the context of employment, childbirth has to be construed as a natural incident of life and, hence, provisions for maternity leave must be construed in that perspective,” observed the bench.Published By: Vivek Published On: May 23, 2025Tune InMust Watch IN THIS STORY#Supreme

Sumi RajappanRaipur,UPDATED: May 24, 2025 00:35 ISTEdited By: Prateek ChakrabortyIn ShortBasavaraju, CPI (Maoist)'s General Secretary, was gunned down in ChhattisgarhHe shifted Maoists from politics to aggressive militarisation since 2018With his death, Maoists' strength shrank to 2 bureaus due to intelligence gainsThe recent elimination of Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju, the General Secretary of the banned CPI (Maoist), in a meticulously planned District Reserve Guard (DRG) operation in Chhattisgarh's Abujhmadh, was more than just a tactical victory. His death marked a possible turning point in India's decades-long struggle against left-wing extremism.""This was no ordinary kill. Basavaraju, an engineering dropout from Andhra Pradesh, was not just a guerrilla commander. He was the ideological and military head of India's most potent insurgent force. He succeeded Ganapathy in 2018 and brought a militant edge to the party, shifting focus from political mobilisation to aggressive militarisation,"" said RK Vij, a former DGP, who played a significant role in the formation of DRG unit of Chhattisgarh Police in 2015.advertisementFor five years, Basavaraju not only reorganised armed units, but also centralised decision-making to counter state surveillance and force penetration, Vij added. Now, in the aftermath of his death, the question lingers: Who will step in?The CPI (Maoist) is not just a conventional militant group. It is a structured political party with a multi-tiered hierarchy from village-level cells to the politburo, and at the top, the general secretary, who operates more like a shadow prime minister of a parallel regime.Vij said, ""The neutralisation of such a heavily guarded general secretary, surrounded by 60-70 armed cadres, shows how deep our intelligence has gone. More importantly, it will shake their cadre's confidence to the core. You will see a rise in surrenders.""The CPI (Maoist)'s armed wing, the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), and United Front are designed to function in tandem. Every few years, the central committee meets to re-evaluate the movement's direction. The last such committee meeting, in 2007, declared Jharkhand and Bihar as 'Aadhaar Kshetras' (core areas) and strategised the shift from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare, a more agile, aggressive form of insurgency.advertisementHowever, due to increased state pressure, Central Committee meetings have become rare, leaving the politburo and its general secretary with disproportionate decision-making power. Now that Basavaraju is gone, this vacuum will need urgent filling.THE TOP CONTENDERS: DEVJI AND VENUGOPAL RAO (BHUPATHY)DEVJI, THE HARDLINER AND MILITARY EXPERTDevji's journey in the Maoist movement began as a fierce field commander, reportedly trained in the early 1990s during the unification of People's War Group (PWG) factions. He was instrumental in launching the PLGA's first armed platoon and led the 2007 attack on Geedam police station in Dantewada, a brazen act that solidified his military reputation.Currently, Devji heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), the highest operational command of the PLGA. This was the same position held by Basavaraju before he became the general secretary.""Devji is not just a field operative, he's a strategist. He understands terrain, troop movement and morale. His elevation to the general secretary would signal a return to militant hard-lining,"" Vij said.Devji is said to have influence across southern Chhattisgarh, especially in Bastar and Dantewada, and is deeply trusted by the central military wing. But what Devji lacks is ideological finesse - the kind required to balance politics and arms.advertisementVENUGOPAL RAO ALIAS BHUPATHY: THE LONGTIME POLITICO MILITARY BRAINIn contrast, Venugopal Rao, also known as Bhupathy, is an ideologue with a gun. A seasoned Central Committee member, he was once considered a rival to Basavaraju. His roots in the movement go back to the formation of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DSZC) in 1995, where he was the first general secretary, overseeing expansion into Chhattisgarh.Venugopal comes from Andhra Pradesh and is fluent in Telugu, Gondi and Hindi - a crucial asset for communication in tribal belts. He currently heads the central bureau, which oversees Maoist operations across Chhattisgarh, North Telangana, parts of Maharashtra and Odisha (MMC [Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh] corridor).""He knows the geography, culture and conflict points of central India like the back of his hand. His political sharpness and combat credibility make him a strong contender,"" Vij said.Unlike Devji, Venugopal's strength lies in his ability to build political consensus, manage local recruitment and negotiate inter-regional Maoist dynamics. However, his age, likely nearing 70, could be a constraint in fast-moving military scenarios.THE RED CORRIDOR: THE ROAD AHEADThe CPI (Maoist) once controlled five operational bureaus across India. Today, that number has shrunk to just two - the Central Bureau and the Eastern Bureau (covering Bihar and Jharkhand). This organisational contraction is a direct result of relentless pressure from state forces and improved intelligence penetration.advertisementThe outfit may now opt for decentralised leadership rather than appointing a single general secretary. This model, while safer, dilutes ideological unity, something Basavaraju had tightly controlled.""With Basavaraju gone, we're likely to see more regional commanders acting independently. It's the beginning of disintegration. They will still be dangerous, but not unified,"" Vij warned.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: May 24, 2025ALSO READ | Bill to curb urban naxalism to be tabled in Maharashtra, Opposition

Among the claims, Cudi alleged that Diddy once broke into his home, set his Porsche on fire, and locked his dog in the bathroom.Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, briefly dated singer Cassie Ventura, Diddy’s former girlfriend. His testimony followed statements from several of Diddy's former employees, sex workers, a federal agent, and a psychologist.advertisementClarifying the timeline of his relationship with Cassie, Cudi said, ""I only dated her when she and Diddy were going through problems and weren’t together anymore."" He also recalled taking Cassie to a hotel at one point to keep her away from Diddy, which reportedly left the producer “seething” when he found out. Cudi testified that he once received a call informing him that Diddy and another man had broken into his home. While driving back, Cudi called Diddy, who allegedly told him, ""I just want to talk to you."" When Cudi replied that he was on his way, Diddy said, ""I’m over here waiting for you.""However, by the time Cudi arrived, Diddy was gone. His house had been ransacked, and his dog had been locked in a bathroom. Cudi immediately contacted the police to report the break-in.advertisementThe situation escalated in January 2012 when Cudi's dog-sitter informed him that his car was on fire. He received photos showing the aftermath, saying, ""The top of my Porsche was cut open, and that’s where the Molotov cocktail was put in.""Following the arson, Cudi agreed to meet Diddy at a hotel. Upon arrival, he said Diddy was “standing there with his hands behind his back like a Marvel supervillain.” When Cudi confronted him about the burned car, Diddy reportedly replied, ""I don’t know what you’re talking about.""After Cudi and Cassie broke up, he said he ran into Diddy again and the latter apologised for everything that had happened.Earlier in the trial, Cassie testified that she ended her relationship with Diddy in 2018. During cross-examination, Diddy’s lawyer accused her of “living two different lives.”Sean “Diddy” Combs is currently facing multiple charges, including sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transporting individuals for prostitution. He was arrested in September and has pleaded not guilty to all charges.Published By: Anisha RaoPublished On: May 23, 2025ALSO READ | Diddy Trial: Shocking hotel video shows alleged assault of Cassie VenturaTrending Reel Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchPakistan Rejected IndiGo Flight's Request To Enter Airspace, Leading To TurbulenceTrump Revokes Harvard's Ability To Host International Students, Affecting IndiansNot too concerned: RCB head coach on long 20-day break before SRH clashRahul Gandhi Accuses PM Modi Of Compromising India's Prestige In Op SindoorWatch: Pak leaders celebrate Asim Munir's promotion to Field Marshal in grand eventAdvertisementRead ThisRapper Kid Cudi testifies against Sean Diddy Combs, alleges break-in and arsonHonor 400 and Honor 400 Pro launched, 200MP camera insideStarship launch on May 27: Musk gets green light, debris zone expandedITC share price rises 3% today.

Edited by: Rohit Paul India News Jun 09, 2023 14:23 pm IST Published On Jun 09, 2023 14:18 pm IST Last Updated On Jun 09, 2023 14:23 pm IST Read Time: 5 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email The neighbour said he first noticed the smell on Monday. Mumbai: A man wearing a helmet and a mask, with only his bloodshot eyes visible - this was the sight that greeted a neighbour in his first-ever interaction with Manoj Sane, the man accused of murdering 32-year-old Saraswati Vaidya and chopping up her body in Mumbai.In an interview with NDTV, Somesh Srivastava - the neighbour who noticed the smell, confronted 56-year-old Sane and alerted the police - gave details of how Sane was caught on Wednesday evening. He spoke of how the police ensured everything looked normal so that Sane would not be spooked when he came back to the society in Mira Road's Geeta Nagar, and how Sane nearly managed to give them the slip despite this. ""We first noticed the smell on Monday. We thought that a rat must have died somewhere in the society and ignored it,"" Mr Srivastava told NDTVHe said that the stench was unbearable when he came home for lunch on Wednesday. ""I suspected something was amiss. If an animal had died in someone's house, they would have noticed and cleaned it in three days,"" Mr Srivastava said. That's when he decided to knock on the door of Sane's flat. ""There was no response initially. When I knocked again after 5-10 minutes, I could hear him spraying air freshener all over the house. The sound was quite loud and I could tell that Sane was spraying inside the room and around the door as well,"" said Mr Srivastava, adding that he stood at the door for another 10 minutes, but Sane did not answer. On what happened when he spoke to Sane, Mr Srivastava said, ""When I finally spoke to Sane, I noticed he was shivering and his eyes were red. He had a helmet on, and a mask, and only his bloodshot eyes were visible. He left the society and I called the building secretary."" Asked what he saw when the police were contacted and he entered the flat, Mr Srivastava said, ""When the door was broken open, we went straight to the bedroom and saw a black plastic sheet covering the bed. We thought there could be a dead body beneath it, but there was nothing.""""A tree-cutting machine was kept next to the bed. We found nothing in the other bedroom and the washroom either. The kitchen was where we found the body parts, kept in buckets. There were bones, blood and muscles,"" he added.Asked how Sane was caught, Mr Srivastava said the flat's real estate agent, who had reached the spot, gave the police all the information that was in the rent agreement.""An hour had passed since Sane had left and the police told us not to answer too many phone calls and ensure everything looked normal, since Sane had told me he would be back by 10.30 pm. They said if Sane saw a crowd gathered in the society when he returned, he would leave. There was no police car and the cops parked their bike out of sight,"" said Mr Srivastava. The cops had reached the society at 7 pm and Sane returned around 8.30 pm. ""He used the lift and came upstairs. He saw police personnel in uniform and got scared. Sane knew he could not use the stairs to flee and, coincidentally, a constable, who was heading downstairs, had entered the lift before Sane got off,"" he added.""The police did not know his face and did not know it was him. The agent was the one who told the police it was Sane and that's how he was caught. Sane was trying to hide his face and go back downstairs. He would have probably fled if he had managed to do that,"" said the neighbour.When Mr Srivastava was asked whether he had spoken to either Sane or Saraswati Vaidya before, he said they would leave the house and exit the society immediately. ""They wouldn't stop anywhere in the society and then shut the door immediately after coming back,"" he added.

Experts highlighted the urgent need to address AMR, discussing its implications for medical treatments and public health. Apr 07, 2025 13:29 pm IST Published On Apr 07, 2025 13:29 pm IST Last Updated On Apr 16, 2025 13:16 pm IST Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Dr. Indira Chakravarty, a distinguished Public Health Specialist and Padma Shri awardee in 2014, elaborates on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), a growing global health concern. AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, and parasites evolve to resist treatments, making infections harder to manage. Dr. Chakravarty emphasises that simple hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing, safe food handling, and proper vaccination, play a critical role in preventing the proliferation of resistant strains. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Dr. Narendra Saini from the Indian Medical Association warns that irrational use of antimicrobials in humans, crops, and the environment leads to resistance. He explains that when these powerful medicines are administered whether to humans, in agricultural practices, or even in environmental contexts microbes can rapidly adapt, resulting in drug resistance. This resistance jeopardizes effective treatment options for infections and may lead to a potential third pandemic if not addressed properly. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Ravi Bhatnagar emphasised Dettol Banega Swasth India's dedication to promoting awareness about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). He said, ""Dettol #BanegaSwasthIndia is committed to integrating AMR awareness into our existing hygiene programs. We understand the importance of educating from a young age, so we're developing child-friendly resources, conducting behavioral research, and will look into using local languages to spread the message. Ultimately, we must emphasise the importance of personal hygiene and responsible antibiotic use, working together to safeguard our future."" Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Dr. Neelam Kler warns that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in neonatal sepsis causes 60,000 deaths annually, with treatment costs for AMR infections significantly higher, increasing financial burdens. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Sunita George, Principal of Bombay Scottish, Mumbai, emphasizes that schools are vital in raising awareness about AMR, highlighting the need for hygiene education, particularly promoting handwashing among students. She said, ""School can contribute to spreading awareness because we have a larger impact. In case of AMR, it requires a behavioural change. Hence, it is important we talk to children about hygiene, especially handwashing."" Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email According to WHO, ""Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health and development threats.
